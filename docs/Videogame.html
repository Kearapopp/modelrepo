            <h2>VideoGame Analysis</h2>
            <figure>
                <a> The game I played, and have started to analyze is the game Where the Goats are
                    by Memory of God. </a>
                <img src="images/Basic%20game%20photo.png" alt="a photoof the video gamd" />
                <figcaption> This is what the game looks like when first laoding on. In this game
                    you play as Tikvah who lives in her home with some farm animals. She cares for
                    her goats, and chickens. In the game you are tasked to milk the goats, water the
                    plant, get the eggs from the chickens, and even get supplies like hay from the
                    visitor. As you can see in the photo that space is where you can travel and walk around. You can leave the fence and go to the well on the right but that it is, a very stationary game. The background noise heard throughout the game is simple, calming music along with the noise of birds chirping, crows, and chickens. When interacting with the water, milk, or the fire they also make the noises in the game.</figcaption>

            <figure>
                <img src="images/Man%20visits.png" alt="another video game image with the visitor" />
                <figcaption> This is the man who visits that we get supplies from. The game lets you interact with him everytime he happens to come, so it is random when he may arrive. </figcaption>
            </figure>

                    <a> Trhoughout the game we also get many letters from what seems to be Tikvah's siblings and grandchilden. As the game progresses we receive more letters and the message behind them seems to become more serious and sad. With being only left with things like a napkin to write on, and the letters becoming more ripped and messy it leaves us to assume that the life they are living is going down very fast.. </a>
                    <img src="images/Letter%20%231.jpg" alt="a photo of a letter from the game" /> <img src="images/Letter%20%232.jpg" alt="a photo of a letter from the game" />
                    <figcaption> This is the first ever letter that we recieve. In it it discusses how the city life is from Semba, her brother. He talks about her cheese and how it could be sold for so much more in the city. He also touches into not having enough money to afford things like cheese. From this letter we learn her family has left the small area with her goats for the city life, in which she was offered to go to but decided agaisnt it as she couldn't raise her goats there. The second letter seems to be from someone younger. They refer to their mom in the letetr and call Tikvah "baba" this gives the message that it is her grandchildren who are also writing her. We also learn from her letter that there are issues with saftey for this family. Her mother and father fight about if the city is safer compared to the farm but we dont discover what they may be trying to hide from. This part of the story starts to raise the questions of what had them move to the city? As well what danger are they nervous about coming into? As we progress in the game we start to learn.</figcaption>

                    <img src="images/Storm%20game%20image.jpg" alt="another video game image with the storm" />
                    <figcaption> As we reach the end of the game, making our cheese, milking the goats, and trading with the visitor a storm starts to slowly emeger throughout. This image is the storm at its worst at the very end. This is important to the progress because it's during these storms that Tikvah loses both her goats to one running away and another dying. We also still recieve more letters but they are starting to raise more and more concern as they come in. </figcaption>
                </figure>
                <figure>
                    <img src="images/Goat%20Dies.jpg" alt="another video game image where the goat dies" />
                    <figcaption> This is where we see the last of Tikvah's goats and it passes away. The game lets us give him a grave in the yard in order to remember him. This I think is meant to show that the goat dies but also to be a symbol for the tragety of what happended to her family in the city as we do not recieve another letter after this and the game comes to a end. I think the goat passing is meant to show both Tikvah becoming alone in her little place out in the farm land, but to also show that something has happened to her family in the city. Meaning that outside of this farm she now also remains alone from those close to her as they may have passed away.  </figcaption>
