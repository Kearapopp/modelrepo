                <figcaption> This is what the game looks like when first laoding on. In this game
                    you play as Tikvah who lives in her home with some farm animals. She cares for
                    her goats, and chickens. In the game you are tasked to milk the goats, water the
                    plant, get the eggs from the chickens, and even get supplies like hay from the
                    visitor. </figcaption>
