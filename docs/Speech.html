        <section>
            <a> The top two most freuqent N-grams are different from each other but only slightly.
                With Obama sayd "of our" and Trump saying " of the" it intriqued me to see what the
                difference was between what they may be speaking about. Since theyre using simialr
                phrases just with slight changes the context as to what they may be discussing is
                something i looked into further.</a>

            <h2>Here is a deeper look into the use of "of our" and of the in each speech</h2>

                    <img src="images/Obama%20of%20our%20.png"
                        alt="a photo i took of the 2 N-grams of our" />
                    <a> This is the usage of of our we see in Obamas speech. </a>

                    <a> This is the use of "of the" in Trumps speech </a>
                </div>
            </figure>

        </section>
        <section> In this we can see that Obama uses of our in order to talk about mostly the
            country. We see him use of our Nation, of our Country, and of our Liberty multiple
            different times in different context. Whereas in Trump's speech he uses of the as a way
            to refer to more of a bigger group. With refering to the world, the earth, and the human
            race. So in Trumps speech he is discussing more of the world rather than just the United
            States like we see Obama do. This raises the question of what main points each tried to
            get across and how being specific to different quanities of groups can have affect on
            their message? </section>

                    <img src="images/Obama%20Voyant.png" alt="a photo of obamas voyant" />
                    <a> These are the words that Obama used in his speech. The larger the word the
                        more it was used. </a>
                </div>
                <div class="flex">

                    <a> This is the voyant of Trumps most used words.</a>
                </div>
            </figure>

        </section>
        <section> In the comparison of Obama and Trumps speech we can see words like nation, people,
            liberty, and even new be used between both. The major difference however that I have
            noticed between the both is the amount of times each one is used. In Obamas speech one
            of his most common used words is "people" and yet in Trump's speech the word "people" is
            signifcantly smaller in comparison. As well as in Trump's speech both "nations" and
            "world" are his two biggest words yet in Obamas nation is there and is smaller, but
            world has a drastic change in size, where it is even difficult to find due to it being
            so small. I think that the size difference in these words goes along with the scope that
            both presidents talked in their speech, this was also detected in their N-grams. In
            Obamas speech he is talking more about the United States and the people, whereas in
            Trump's she is more focused on the nations, and the world as a whole. </section>

            <a> The top N-grams for Trumps second speech are different from his first and more
                similar to Obama's. Trumps most freguent N-gram has changed from being "of the" into
                "we will" This was a interesting change to discover from look at the first and
                second speech. The shift from talking about the world and nation and contradicting
                Obama's speech into the more United States focused speech in his second was a major
                shift we see. </a>

            <a> In Trump's first inaguration speech he was talking in more broad term using the
                nations, and the world multiple times throughout the speech. However in this one we
                see the shift change into the change in the United States specifically. Talking
                about things like "we will bring back jobs" or "we will bring back our dreams." He
                is now talking to the people about them specifically and centering onto the issue in
                this country rather than looking at the country and all others around us. In his
                Voyant the biggest word he uses is America, this shows just how much he has changed
                from speech one to speech two with his last most used word was nations, now to it
                being america. His main points when giving the speech have now become more similar
                to the Obama's speech where we are seeing the American people being the vocal point,
                and the main group of people is is reaching and speaking to. I find it interesting
                and a question raising change into what made him do this shift, and how exactly this
                shift may have chnaged the way people view him and his ideas. Overall the change
                between his speech having a very different message, and group of people Trump was
                reaching out to. To the second speech more similar to Obama's and also reaching out
                to a different set of people from his first it can create a good way at showing
                either improvement, or not depending on the person. Either way with using tools like
                antconc and voyant its easy to se the major changes, differences, and similarites
                that Trump's two speech and Obama's speech has. </a>
