The challenges in our own lives can feel like they threaten to overpower us. And the struggles we see in the world further add to the burden. Peace from Anxiety helps us understand the deep roots of our suffering and work toward finding more peace even in the midst of what can seem like chaos. Author Hala Khouri takes readers on a journey to investigate our personal habits and lives to understand and transform what doesn't serve us. Even though the roots of our anxiety, stress, and pain may feel complicated, healing doesn't have to be. Hala explores how our brain and nervous system experience stress and discusses how we can begin to get in touch with our body to better understand its signals and how to handle them. She delves deeply into some of our primary sources of anxiety and offers practical tools for releasing stress and being present with discomfort. The book discusses topics including trauma, relationships, technology, and it also discusses working not only for individual healing but also collective healing in our world. Filled with relatable stories and examples, each chapter offers a range of practices and tools to help us find more peace and work for good in our own lives and the lives of others""--","2021","2025-03-21 19:01:54","2025-03-21 19:06:17","","","247","","","","","Peace from anxiety","","","","","Shambhala Publications, Inc","Boulder, Colorado","","","","","","Library Catalog (Blacklight)","BF575.A6 K55 2021","OCLC: 1178638184","","","https://catalog.libraries.psu.edu/catalog/35860785","physical","Anxiety; PSYCHOLOGY / General; Self-help publications; Stress (Psychology); Stress management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Social anxiety has a pervasive effect on interpersonal functioning, resulting in smaller social networks, increased likelihood of being single or divorced, and less intimacy in relationships. However, little is known about how relationships affect socially anxious individuals in return. We utilized a structured interview to assess how romantic relationships were perceived as influencing three aspects of psychological health (well-being, social anxiety and comfort in social situations) and whether these patterns differed as a function of social anxiety in an undergraduate sample. The perceived importance of several reasons for these effects, including those that could be characterized as both protective and harmful, was also assessed. Relationships were perceived as having contributed positively in each domain. However, when positive and negative reasons were examined separately, socially anxious individuals reported benefiting more from the positive reasons and being harmed more by negative reasons. Further, social anxiety was associated with endorsing certain reasons as important.","2012","2025-03-24 18:46:18","2025-03-24 18:46:33","","140-151","","2","41","","Cogn Behav Ther","Romantic relationships","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 22413773","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22413773","web","Adolescent; Adult; Arousal; Dependency, Psychological; Female; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Love; Male; Middle Aged; Object Attachment; Personality Inventory; Phobic Disorders; Psychometrics; Quality of Life; Social Adjustment; Social Identification; Social Perception; Social Support; Students; Young Adult","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
